# RANGER

## Project set up

Ranger uses [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation.
Jekyll is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) gem, so you'll need to install Ruby.

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

## Dev'ing

### Run dev server
```bash
jekyll serve
```

### Build Project
```bash
jekyll build
```




## Dev Notes

### 11/7 7PM - 12PM
- Decided on jekyll for static site generation.
- Will prob use bootstrap template and bootstrap ui for major
	components
- Focus MUST be on simplicity and easy usage for common use cases
	- New Dog
	- Dog Adopted
	- General CnC Info changes (address/phone changes)
	- Associated organization changes
- Biggest pain points will be:
	- Carousel on front page and available dogs
	- Application form and comm (I promise to try to leave as much as possible
		unchanged)
